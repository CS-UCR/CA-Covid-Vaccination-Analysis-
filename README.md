# Project Name:- Covid Vaccine Data California 

### Overview:- As California begins opening up it becomes important to learn about how many people have been vaccinated in California and how many cases, deaths, and tests occurred in California . 
We will extract and analyze this information in our project. 

### Extract:- Below are all the things that will be extracted from this data in our project. 
Total doses given at specific date \
Number of pfizer doses given \
Number of moderna doses given \
Number of JJ does given \
Number of people fully vaccinated \
Number of people partially vaccinated \
At least one dose \
Chart showing vaccination and cases correlation 

First, we will import the latest csv file into jupyter notebook and start the data cleaning process.  \
There are certain columns that we will not need like California flag status so we will drop that. Also, certain rows include the data from non CA counties as well, \
so we will get rid of that as well. We also merge any relevant data from both data sets into one data frame. We are thinking of displaying the above \
results by finding mean and standard deviation and then represent them visually. We can work with the data more once we start the process. \
